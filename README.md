Review: The site looks great and there are not many issues with it, code is also very well written. When you click the favorites btn it seems to have two undefined pokemon but other than that it works fine. I love how the evolutions look like



Notes:
+ Current logic for evolution uses the name of the pokemon to populate the div. Would need to change it to get the id instead because not all of the pokmeon can be searched using /pokemonName but can be accessed using /pokemonID. 
+ input bar when website is in tablet in mobile only work if you hit enter, not the search button
